                    access basic essentials, and the little supplies they do have are quickly running out. The strong
                    winds and heavy rain continue to put lives and property at risk. Entire livelihoods, cattle and
                    farmland are destroyed, leaving people with absolutely nothing. Please help us help them, today.</p>

                <p>We also believe there is an opportunity to reduce suffering by taking a proactive approach to
                    disasters, so we work to reduce communities’ underlying vulnerabilities and build cultures of
                    resilience.
